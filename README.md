## 🐱 Fortune Cat
This repository contains my **Fortune Cat** project, a charming Python script featuring a digital **Maneki-neko** (beckoning cat). This project was created to practice fundamental programming concepts while spreading a little bit of joy!

## 📂 What’s Inside:
- **Randomized Logic:** A script that selects from 99 unique, happy fortunes.
- **ASCII Art Graphics:** A custom terminal-based cat design that "speaks" to the user.
- **Interactive Console:** A user-friendly interface that responds to fortune requests.

## 🎨 Languages Used:
- **Python:** Used for the core logic, random selection module, and terminal output handling.

## 📝 P.S.:
I created this project to start the **New Year** on a high note! Every single fortune in this code is designed to be positive and encouraging, because I believe everyone deserves a happy start to their year. This project helped me get comfortable with Python lists and the random module. May this Fortune Cat bring you lots of luck! ✨
